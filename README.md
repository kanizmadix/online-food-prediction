# Online Food Order Prediction 🍽️

An interactive machine learning project that predicts whether a customer will order food online based on various demographic and behavioral features.

## 📊 Dataset Overview

The dataset (`onlinefoods.csv`) contains customer information and their food ordering behavior with the following features:

- **Age**: Customer's age
- **Gender**: Customer's gender (Male/Female)
- **Marital Status**: Single or Married
- **Occupation**: Employment status (Student, Employee)
- **Monthly Income**: Income brackets (No Income, Below Rs.10000, More than 50000)
- **Educational Qualifications**: Graduate, Post Graduate
- **Family Size**: Number of family members
- **Location**: Latitude and Longitude coordinates
- **Pin Code**: Area pin code
- **Output**: Whether they ordered food (Yes/No)
- **Feedback**: Customer feedback (Positive/Negative)
